    The vast majority of my bots are separated out by world/setting and listed there. Here is a list of bots not assigned to a world or to an external world such as Islaport:

    <h2>Worlds</h2>
    Here is a list of all my worlds and settings and the content therein; bots and lorebooks but also trivia that might be fun to add in RP.

    <h3><a href="/Giranda">Girandia</a></h3>
    The largest world for mostly slife-of-life bots. An urban fantasy comparable to contemporary earth. Includes elves, kemonomimi, spiritual/mystical beings and magic.

    <h3><a href="/Zaveram">Zaveram</a></h3>
    Originally a world part of a collab between YÃ¦thi and myself. Will still try to goad her into a collab in this world from time to time.

    <h3><a href="/GrandRepublic">Grand Republic</a></h3>
    Spices in space! Basically a fever dream about what would happen if the Dutch Republic made it to space.

    <h3>Contact</h3>
    Blah blah blah
