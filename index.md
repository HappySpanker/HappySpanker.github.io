## Bots

The vast majority of my bots are separated out by world/setting and listed there. Here is a list of bots not assigned to a world or to an external world such as Islaport:

<table id="myTable" class="display">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Column 1</th>
            <th>Column 2</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1-1</td>
            <td>1-2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2-1</td>
            <td>2-2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3-1</td>
            <td>3-2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4-1</td>
            <td>4-2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5-1</td>
            <td>5-2</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Worlds

Here is a list of all my worlds and settings and the content therein; bots and lorebooks but also trivia that might be fun to add in RP.

### [Girandia](/Girandia)

The largest world for mostly slife-of-life bots. An urban fantasy comparable to contemporary earth. Includes elves, kemonomimi, spiritual/mystical beings and magic.

### [Zaveram](/Zaveram)

Originally a world part of a collab between YÃ¦thi and myself. Will still try to goad her into a collab in this world from time to time.

### [Grand Republic](/GrandRepublic)

Spices in space! Basically a fever dream about what would happen if the Dutch Republic made it to space.
